# Time Table Scheduler


This project leverages capabilities of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address the complexities of university timetable scheduling, a challenging NP-hard optimization problem. Targeting academic institutions facing intricate scheduling demands, the system provides an adaptive solution that optimizes schedules for a single batch, accommodating diverse hard and soft constraints. 


## Features

- Secure login functionality for administrators
- Intuitive interface for administrators to input course requirements and faculty assignment.
- Strategic optimization with GA by assigning varied weights to manage constraint violations of varying significance and introducing mutations to minimize losses. 
- Presents a visually appealing and clear timetable for effective comprehension.


## Prerequisites
- Python programming language 

- Front-end technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.

- Firebase provides a NoSQL cloud database that allows developers to store and sync data in real-time across connected clients and offers tools for user authentication.

- Flask for web application development.

- Genetic Algorithm and Constraint Satisfaction Problem Algorithm
